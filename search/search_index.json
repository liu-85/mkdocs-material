It can be installed with:</p> <pre><code>pip install mkdocs-exclude-search\n</code></pre> <p>How it works: the plugin post-processes the <code>search_index.json</code> file that is generated by the built-in search plugin, giving the author the ability to exclude certain pages and sections by adding a few lines of configuration to <code>mkdocs.yml</code>. An example:</p> <pre><code>plugins:\n  - search\n  - exclude-search:\n      exclude:\n        - page.md\n        - page.md#section\n        - directory/*\n        - /*/page.md\n</code></pre> <p>It's easy to see that the plugin follows a configuration-centric approach, which adds support for advanced filtering techniques like infix- and suffix-filtering using wildcards. While this is a very powerful idea, it comes with some downsides:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Exclusion patterns and content are not co-located: exclusion patterns     need to be defined in <code>mkdocs.yml</code>, and not as part of the respective     document or section to be excluded.

However, Asian languages are tokenized using a dedicated segmenter, which cannot be modeled with regular expressions.</p> <p>[^6]:     Using the separator as defined in <code>mkdocs.yml</code>, a regular expression was     constructed that was trying to mimic the tokenizer.

I wanted to release my latest Open Source project protobluff, a zero-copy Protocol Buffers implementation for C, which I've created as part of my former startup. As the project has a significant degree of complexity, I quickly realized that I was in need of good user documentation.</p> <p>After evaluating static site generators in general and Hugo, Sphinx and MkDocs in particular, I quickly decided that MkDocs seemed a good choice, as it was specifically aimed at technical project documentation and easy to use. Unfortunately, all of the available themes looked dated and given that I'm a very visual person, I just couldn't convince myself to call it a day.</p> <p>I had to build a theme.</p> <p>Months later, in February 2016, I released the first version of Material for MkDocs (and with it, protobluff, the project I wanted to release in the first place), and it looked like this:</p> <p></p> <p>It was already fully responsive and overall, well, quite okayish, but barely customizable, as only the logo could be changed.

There's no glory in themes, no stars to earn (remember that I was new in Open Source, so this was the metric I was optimizing for), as there are thousands and thousands of options. However, as the years progressed, I learned that execution matters: although Material for MkDocs solves a problem for which thousands of solutions exist, it excels in a specific niche, and that niche is to be known as technical project documentation.</p> <p>Today, this project is not only popular but funded by almost 300 individuals and organizations, resulting in a yearly budget of more than $50,000. This allows me to set aside enough time for the development of new features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general support and still feels like a dream to me, as there are many failed stories of Open Source funding and people telling you: don't do Open Source, you'll be working for free.</p> <p>Making Open Source sustainable is, after all, possible in 2021.</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/the-past-present-and-future/#2021-in-numbers","title":"2021 in numbers","text":"<p>2021 was an exciting year, as the project has seen significant growth.</p> <p>166k people visited the official documentation in 2021, totalling in 1,6m page views which is an increase of 83% when compared to 2020.

Tens of thousands of authors rely on us to deliver documentation to millions of users each month.[^1] Beyond its adoption by many popular Open Source projects, Material for MkDocs is trusted and financially supported by major corporations such as AWS, Microsoft, and Siemens, among many other companies and individuals. We're very grateful for the continued support we receive, which allows us to devote our time to this project, making writing documentation enjoyable.</p> <p>[^1]:     We've collected invaluable feedback from enterprises and other Open Source maintainers, which revealed that the actual numbers are even higher.

From the start, we've relied on Lunr.js, a popular client-side search library that has streamlined the deployment of documentation sites without needing an external service. Over the years, Lunr.js has served us well by answering millions of queries on sites built with Material for MkDocs. Yet, as our users' needs evolved, we encountered limitations that proved difficult to overcome.</p> <p>We learned that the BM25 ranking algorithm at the core of Lunr.js (as in many other search implementations) isn't well-suited for effective and stable typeahead. Adding new documents can influence existing rankings, requiring manual adjustments[^3] that are cumbersome and hard to scale. Furthermore, Lunr.js has performance issues that stem from its design not fully leveraging modern JavaScript engines and optimizations, making it slower and memory-intensive.[^4]</p> <p>[^3]:     Boosting documents in BM25 can lead to challenges, particularly with a changing corpus of documents. Relevance is calculated based on term frequency and the importance of terms across the entire corpus. Boosting a document involves adjusting its weight to make it more prominent in search results.</p> <pre><code>As new documents are added or existing ones are modified, the overall distribution of term frequencies and their importance can shift. This recalibration can diminish the effectiveness of the boost, making it harder to maintain consistent ranking across a changing dataset. Essentially, the boosted documents may not stay as prominent or relevant as intended, leading to imbalances and scalability issues in search results.\n</code></pre> <p>[^4]:     Lunr.js uses JavaScript objects to index and manage search data, which introduces inefficiencies due to how JavaScript engines handle object operations. JavaScript engines optimize performance using techniques like inline caching and object shape optimization. However, these optimizations rely on predictable and consistent object structures.</p> <pre><code>The dynamic nature of Lunr.js' indexing \u2014 where documents can have varying structures \u2014 prevents the engine from applying these optimizations effectively. This means that while JavaScript engines can optimize for fixed, predictable object structures, they struggle with the polymorphic and fluid nature of Lunr.js's indexing, leading to performance issues as the amount of data grows.\n</code></pre> <p>Over the last years, we've invested substantially into improving the search experience. For instance, expanding Lunr.js' functionality to add support for rich search previews and tokenizer lookahead demanded substantial engineering effort. Lunr.js allows to customize tasks such as stemming, stopword filtering, and trimming with pipeline functions, but it makes it particularly hard to add extensions like term highlighting or alternative ranking methods. Compounded by the fact that Lunr.js has been unmaintained since 2020, it became clear that we needed to find a more powerful solution. We've looked at alternative JavaScript-based libraries to keep our client-side search, but none met our requirements or lived up to our expectations.</p> <p>To address these challenges, we've embarked on developing a new search system from first principles that not only matches but already exceeds the capabilities of Lunr.js. Built from the ground up, this system is faster, more compact, and most importantly: modular. It is based on a growing core evolving around two core concepts we isolated to be essential \u2013 engines and plugins \u2013 allowing for flexible configuration and assembly of components like text indexing, vector embeddings, filtering, ranking, highlighting, and more. Every part of it can be replaced or extended, enabling users to tailor the search system to their specific needs.</p> <p>Our new search system, which we will release as a separate MIT-licensed Open Source project, is designed to handle a wide range of scenarios \u2014 from small blogs to large documentation projects. Of course, it supports offline use and integrates seamlessly with both client and server environments. The advanced ranking system provides fine-tuned control, and integration with third-party services is now more straightforward.</p> <p> Goal \u2013 Empower users to quickly find the information they need while freeing authors from managing external services, by providing a search system that adapts to diverse content types.</p> <p>You might wonder why it's not yet available. The process of developing this system from scratch and uncovering its potential has led us to re-evaluate core concepts of Material for MkDocs. As a result, we've decided to postpone the release of the new search system to integrate it into the broader update that we've started to work on. If you keep on reading, you'll learn about further reasons why we've decided to follow this approach.</p> <p>We're excited to share more details about this update in one of the next posts in this series.</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/transforming-material-for-mkdocs/#translations-and-versioning","title":"Translations and versioning","text":"<p>Supporting multi-language sites in MkDocs is the most requested feature on our discussion board and in conversations with users, yet it presents significant challenges, as MkDocs does not natively support it.

Unfortunately, we encountered significant challenges due to MkDocs' internal architecture and design constraints, which we're working actively on resolving.[^5]</p> <p>[^5]:     When developing the projects plugin, we initially made good progress, including adding support for nested projects and allowing for a tree structure where sub-projects can have further sub-projects. However, we quickly encountered difficulties, particularly with cross-project navigation. To illustrate, imagine that each project can link to any other project, which makes handling these interconnections complex, especially when dealing with circular dependencies \u2014 such as Project A linking to Project B and vice versa.</p> <pre><code>Implementing multi-project support in MkDocs is particularly challenging due to the lack of an official programmatic API, which complicates efforts to extend its functionality. Moreover, resolving navigation issues before building projects is crucial for ensuring proper interconnectivity. These challenges combined made the development of the projects plugin a complex endeavor.\n</code></pre> <p> Goal \u2013 Enable scaling documentation to any size or team structure by offering seamless methods for integrating multiple documentation projects, whether they involve different languages, versions, or distinct sections of an overall body of work.</p> <p>As a result, we are developing a new approach to offer a more comprehensive and robust solution for both multi-language support and versioning. This new approach also intersects with adjacent functionalities like search, as many of our users are interested in federated search capabilities that combine results from multiple documentation sites into a unified search interface. Overcoming this challenge is one of the major hurdles we need to address before releasing the new search system.</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/transforming-material-for-mkdocs/#editing-and-collaboration","title":"Editing and collaboration","text":"<p>We had considered developing a live editor in response to MkDocs' performance issues with large projects, which in most cases stem from compute-intensive plugins that don't employ caching. A proof of concept based on Pyodide (= running Python in the browser) generated significant interest among users and prompted many organizations and individuals to share their collaborative workflows for feedback. Sadly, implementing this live editor proved to be very challenging, as it would require rebuilding substantial parts of MkDocs.[^6] After discontinuing work on this approach, our progress with multi-project support has renewed our belief that we can finally solve the sluggish editing experience that was reported several times over the last years.[^7]</p> <p>[^6]:     Our proof of concept supported some features of Material for MkDocs but didn't cover them all. For instance, integrating support for icons or linking between documents would have necessitated reimplementing parts of MkDocs to bypass a full rebuild \u2014 something we obviously wanted to avoid. Additionally, certain links, such as those to blog posts generated from schemas, are not merely translated but computed dynamically, which means they cannot be inferred by replacing the <code>.md</code> extension with <code>.html</code>.</p> <p>[^7]:     After we raised this issue with the maintainers of MkDocs again[^8], and maintainership changed mid 2024, work on a ground-up rewrite that aims to address slow reloads by rendering only the page currently being built has started. It's still unclear how this rewrite will integrate with the requirements of existing plugins. Complex plugins such as mkdocstrings, or our built-in blog and tags plugins require a coordinated build of all pages to accurately resolve links between pages and to computed resources, which cannot be determined without building the entire project.</p> <pre><code>__Update__{ title=\"August 21, 2024\" }: The new maintainer now publicly stated that he's working towards a new version of MkDocs that [does not require or support plugins], and mentions it will be equally capable through offering customization via templating, themes, and styling, which he also mentioned to us and several other users in [a team call on August 1]. In this call, [we raised objections multiple times] in regards to how this will impact the ecosystem, to no avail. No intention or roadmap for plugin support was provided. This development is orthogonal to our goal empowering users and organizations to adapt the core framework to their requirements by the means of modularity. We're working on resolving this situation, and will provide a way forward for our community.\n</code></pre> <p>[^8]:     Previously raised issues include #2418, #2384, and #1900.</p> <p>This brings us to collaboration, which wasn't initially on our list of priorities. However, throughout 2024, conversations with various organizations and maintainers of popular Open Source projects highlighted a frequent request for enhanced collaboration features. Many users expressed a need for capabilities that would allow non-technical team members to suggest and make changes to the documentation. We're genuinely grateful for this feedback, as it has come at a pivotal time. We recognize the need to streamline tracking and discussing changes, as well as to facilitate drive-by contributions.</p> <p> Goal \u2013 Everyone, regardless of their technical skill level, can easily work on and improve the documentation and contribute to a growing corpus of knowledge.[^9]</p> <p>[^9]:     We are actively aligning our future development efforts to address this, recognizing it as a key area for improvement. While it's not something we can deliver immediately, we are committed to making this vision a reality in our work.</p> <p>This focus on collaboration aligns with how knowledge is managed in enterprises. In large organizations, documentation often exists in information silos \u2014 decentralized yet essential repositories of information. We understand the need to be able to unify these disparate sources into a coherent body of knowledge while preserving decentralized ownership. This also nicely aligns with our previously outlined work on multi-project support, as well as the new search system to implement federated search among multiple projects.</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/transforming-material-for-mkdocs/#large-language-models-llms","title":"Large Language Models (LLMs)","text":"<p>Almost a year ago, we introduced an experimental chatbot on our documentation site. It quickly became one of the most anticipated features, with users requesting the ability to deploy similar functionality on their own sites, underscoring the growing demand for interactive documentation tools. However, we found that adding to the myriad of existing chat solutions and simply building another thin wrapper on top of ChatGPT is nonsense.</p> <p> Goal \u2013 We're envisioning creating a unified interface that seamlessly integrates advanced search, chat, and summarization features, providing an interactive documentation experience.</p> <p>As we delved into this ambitious project, we gained valuable insights from user feedback. Users began interacting with the chatbot in their native languages, an outcome we hadn't anticipated given that our documentation is in English. Remarkably (or obviously to those that work on LLMs year round), the chatbot responded in the same language. This ability of LLMs is one of the genuinely exciting features of these machine learning models as it has the potential to improve the accessibility of the documentation. However, while we employed state-of-the-art RAG methodologies, the results were mixed, and occasional hallucinations surfaced.</p> <p>These experiences led us to prioritize enhancing our search capabilities before integrating LLM-based features. Building a search engine from scratch was already a substantial effort, and adding more complexity without a solid search foundation would be premature. By rearchitecting our search functionalities, we aim to create a robust platform that will seamlessly support advanced information retrieval and deliver a cohesive interactive documentation experience.</p>"},{"location":"blog/posts/transforming-material-for-mkdocs/#team-transparency-and-growth","title":"Team, transparency, and growth","text":"<p>While we navigate the challenges and explore the opportunities of this project, we consider it essential to demonstrate how we're building a solid foundation for its continued growth and success.

This provides you with a repository that you    can push changes to. Note that it is not possible to have more than one fork    of a given repository at any point in time. So, the fork you create will be    the fork you have.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once it is made, clone it to your local machine so you can start working on    your changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>All contributions should be made through a 'topic branch' with a name that    describes the work being done. This allows you to have more than one piece    of work in progress and, if you are working with the public version, also    shows others clearly that the code contained is work in progress. The topic    branch will be relatively short-lived and will disappear at the end, when    your changes have been incorporated into the codebase.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you intend to make any code changes, as opposed to working on    documentation only, you will need to set up a development    environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next comes the iterative process of making edits, committing them to your     clone. Please commit in sensible chunks that constitute a piece of work     instead of committing everything in one go.</p> <p>Remember that fine-grained, incremental commits are much easier to review in than large changes all over the place and with many files involved. Try to keep your changes as small and localized as possible and keep the reviewer in mind when committing. In particular, make sure to write meaningful commit messages.</p> </li> <li> <p>Push your work up to your fork regularly.</p> </li> <li> <p>You should also keep an eye on changes in the Material for MkDocs repository    you cloned. This is especially important if you work takes a while. Please    try and merge any concurrent changes into your fork and into your branch    regularly. You must do this at least once before creating a pull request,    so make your life easier and do it more often so as to minimize the risk of    conflicting changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once you are happy that your changes are in a state that you can describe    them in a draft pull request, you should create this. Make sure to    reference any previous discussions or issues that gave rise to your work.    Creating a draft is a good way to get early feedback on your work from the    maintainer or others. You can explicitly request reviews at points where you    think this would be important.</p> </li> <li> <p>Review your work as if you were the reviewer and fix any issues with your     work so far. Look critically at the diffs of the files that you have changed.     In particular, pay attention to whether the changes are as small as possible     and whether you have follow the general coding style used in the project.     If you received feedback, iterate over the process so far as necessary.</p> <p>You should choose a number of projects to test your changes with.

Unfortunately, all of the available themes looked dated, and since @squidfunk is a very visual person, he just couldn't convince himself to call it a day.</p> <p>He needed to build a theme.</p> <p>Months later, in February 2016, the first version of Material for MkDocs was released. Over the next years, @squidfunk being the sole maintainer, countless feature requests were implemented and bugs were fixed, allowing the project to gain popularity and reach almost 3,000 stars on GitHub by the end of 2019. It is still his most popular project to date.</p> <p>As the project grew, @squidfunk started to implement feature requests that made sense from a general perspective, but not for his personal use. This was the point where the project started to shift from a personal project to a community-driven one, and began to feel like a secondary job. Having a primary job, many maintainers burn out when their side projects become successful, which is why @squidfunk decided to give the Sponsorware model a try and make Material for MkDocs his primary job.

For example, the   offline, optimize and privacy plugins can be used together to build   truly offline-capable documentation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Interoperability: Built-in plugins are designed to be as compatible as   possible, so they can be used in combination with other plugins, including   third-party plugins. We strive to make it simple to integrate with the vast   ecosystem that has evolved around MkDocs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Performance: Built-in plugins are designed to be as fast and   memory-efficient as possible, so that they don't unnecessarily slow down   builds.

Additionally each library <code>name</code> is checked in three variants with the <code>libname.dylib</code>, <code>name.dylib</code> and <code>name.framework/name</code> format.</p> <p>Homebrew should set every needed variable to point at the installed library directory, but if that didn't happen, you can use the debug script below to see what paths are looked up.</p> <p>A known workaround is to add the Homebrew lib path directly before running MkDocs:</p> <pre><code>export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib\n</code></pre> <p>View source code of cairo-lookup-macos.py</p> Python Debug macOS Script<pre><code>curl \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/master/includes/debug/cairo-lookup-macos.py\" | python -\n</code></pre>  Windows <p>On Windows the library lookup checks inside the paths defined in the environmental <code>PATH</code> variable. Additionally each library <code>name</code> is checked in two variants with the <code>name</code> and <code>name.dll</code> format.</p> <p>The default binary and shared library path for the UCRT64 environment of MSYS2, in which the packages were installed using the above commands, is:</p> <pre><code>C:\\msys64\\ucrt64\\bin\n</code></pre> <p>Use the debug script below to check if the path is included. If it isn't then:</p> <ol> <li>Press ++windows+r++.</li> <li>Run the <code>SystemPropertiesAdvanced</code> applet.</li> <li>Select \"Environmental Variables\" at the bottom.</li> <li>Add the whole path to the above directory to your <code>Path</code> variable.</li> <li>Click OK on all open windows to apply changes.</li> <li>Fully restart any open Terminal windows and their parent hosts like IDEs.</li> </ol> You can also list paths using PowerShell<pre><code>$env:Path -split ';'\n</code></pre> <p>View source code of cairo-lookup-windows.py</p> PowerShell - Python Debug Windows Script<pre><code>(Invoke-WebRequest \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/master/includes/debug/cairo-lookup-windows.py\").Content | python -\n</code></pre>  Linux <p>On Linux the library lookup can differ greatly and is dependent from the installed distribution. For tested Ubuntu and Manjaro systems Python runs shell commands to check which libraries are available in <code>ldconfig</code>, in the <code>gcc</code>/<code>cc</code> compiler, and in <code>ld</code>.</p> <p>You can extend the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environmental variable with an absolute path to a library directory containing <code>libcairo.so</code> etc. Run this directly before MkDocs:</p> <pre><code>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/absolute/path/to/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n</code></pre> <p>You can also modify the <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> file.</p> <p>The Python script below shows, which function is being run to find installed libraries.

Most of the\nfonts include several weights and are split up into different character sets\nto keep the download size small, so the browser only downloads what is\nreally needed. For Roboto, our default [regular font], this results in [42\n`*.woff2` files in total][example].\n\nIf Material for MkDocs would bundle all font files, the download size would\nbe in the hundreds of megabytes, slowing down automated builds. Furthermore,\nauthors might add external assets like third-party scripts or style sheets\nthat would need to be remembered to be defined as further local assets.\n\nThis is the very reason the [built-in privacy plugin] exists \u2014 it automates\nthe process of downloading all external assets manually to ensure compliance\nwith GDPR with some some [technical limitations].\n</code></pre> <p>??? example \"Expand to inspect example\"</p> <pre><code>For the official documentation, the [built-in privacy plugin] downloads the\nfollowing resources:\n\n``` { .sh .no-copy #example }\n.\n\u2514\u2500 assets/external/\n   \u251c\u2500 unpkg.com/tablesort@5.3.0/dist/tablesort.min.js\n   \u251c\u2500 fonts.googleapis.com/css\n   \u2514\u2500 fonts.gstatic.com/s/\n      \u251c\u2500 roboto/v29/\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOjCnqEu92Fr1Mu51TjASc-CsTKlA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOjCnqEu92Fr1Mu51TjASc0CsTKlA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOjCnqEu92Fr1Mu51TjASc1CsTKlA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOjCnqEu92Fr1Mu51TjASc2CsTKlA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOjCnqEu92Fr1Mu51TjASc3CsTKlA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOjCnqEu92Fr1Mu51TjASc5CsTKlA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOjCnqEu92Fr1Mu51TjASc6CsQ.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOjCnqEu92Fr1Mu51TzBic-CsTKlA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOjCnqEu92Fr1Mu51TzBic0CsTKlA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOjCnqEu92Fr1Mu51TzBic1CsTKlA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOjCnqEu92Fr1Mu51TzBic2CsTKlA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOjCnqEu92Fr1Mu51TzBic3CsTKlA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOjCnqEu92Fr1Mu51TzBic5CsTKlA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOjCnqEu92Fr1Mu51TzBic6CsQ.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOkCnqEu92Fr1Mu51xEIzIFKw.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOkCnqEu92Fr1Mu51xFIzIFKw.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOkCnqEu92Fr1Mu51xGIzIFKw.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOkCnqEu92Fr1Mu51xHIzIFKw.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOkCnqEu92Fr1Mu51xIIzI.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOkCnqEu92Fr1Mu51xLIzIFKw.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOkCnqEu92Fr1Mu51xMIzIFKw.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOlCnqEu92Fr1MmSU5fABc4EsA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOlCnqEu92Fr1MmSU5fBBc4.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOlCnqEu92Fr1MmSU5fBxc4EsA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOlCnqEu92Fr1MmSU5fCBc4EsA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOlCnqEu92Fr1MmSU5fCRc4EsA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOlCnqEu92Fr1MmSU5fChc4EsA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOlCnqEu92Fr1MmSU5fCxc4EsA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOlCnqEu92Fr1MmWUlfABc4EsA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOlCnqEu92Fr1MmWUlfBBc4.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOlCnqEu92Fr1MmWUlfBxc4EsA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOlCnqEu92Fr1MmWUlfCBc4EsA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOlCnqEu92Fr1MmWUlfCRc4EsA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOlCnqEu92Fr1MmWUlfChc4EsA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOlCnqEu92Fr1MmWUlfCxc4EsA.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOmCnqEu92Fr1Mu4WxKOzY.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOmCnqEu92Fr1Mu4mxK.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOmCnqEu92Fr1Mu5mxKOzY.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOmCnqEu92Fr1Mu72xKOzY.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOmCnqEu92Fr1Mu7GxKOzY.woff2\n      \u2502  \u251c\u2500 KFOmCnqEu92Fr1Mu7WxKOzY.woff2\n      \u2502  \u2514\u2500 KFOmCnqEu92Fr1Mu7mxKOzY.woff2\n      \u2514\u2500 robotomono/v13/\n         \u251c\u2500 L0xTDF4xlVMF-BfR8bXMIhJHg45mwgGEFl0_3vrtSM1J-gEPT5Ese6hmHSV0mf0h.woff2\n         \u251c\u2500 L0xTDF4xlVMF-BfR8bXMIhJHg45mwgGEFl0_3vrtSM1J-gEPT5Ese6hmHSZ0mf0h.woff2\n         \u251c\u2500 L0xTDF4xlVMF-BfR8bXMIhJHg45mwgGEFl0_3vrtSM1J-gEPT5Ese6hmHSd0mf0h.woff2\n         \u251c\u2500 L0xTDF4xlVMF-BfR8bXMIhJHg45mwgGEFl0_3vrtSM1J-gEPT5Ese6hmHSh0mQ.woff2\n         \u251c\u2500 L0xTDF4xlVMF-BfR8bXMIhJHg45mwgGEFl0_3vrtSM1J-gEPT5Ese6hmHSt0mf0h.woff2\n         \u251c\u2500 L0xTDF4xlVMF-BfR8bXMIhJHg45mwgGEFl0_3vrtSM1J-gEPT5Ese6hmHSx0mf0h.woff2\n         \u251c\u2500 L0xdDF4xlVMF-BfR8bXMIjhOsXG-q2oeuFoqFrlnAIe2Imhk1T8rbociImtElOUlYIw.woff2\n         \u251c\u2500 L0xdDF4xlVMF-BfR8bXMIjhOsXG-q2oeuFoqFrlnAIe2Imhk1T8rbociImtEleUlYIw.woff2\n         \u251c\u2500 L0xdDF4xlVMF-BfR8bXMIjhOsXG-q2oeuFoqFrlnAIe2Imhk1T8rbociImtEluUlYIw.woff2\n         \u251c\u2500 L0xdDF4xlVMF-BfR8bXMIjhOsXG-q2oeuFoqFrlnAIe2Imhk1T8rbociImtEm-Ul.woff2\n         \u251c\u2500 L0xdDF4xlVMF-BfR8bXMIjhOsXG-q2oeuFoqFrlnAIe2Imhk1T8rbociImtEmOUlYIw.woff2\n         \u2514\u2500 L0xdDF4xlVMF-BfR8bXMIjhOsXG-q2oeuFoqFrlnAIe2Imhk1T8rbociImtEn-UlYIw.woff2\n```\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"setup/ensuring-data-privacy/#advanced-settings","title":"Advanced settings","text":"<p>The following advanced settings are currently reserved to our sponsors.

You can use a browser like Firefox or Chrome that\ncan display the raw RSS feed or use `curl` to get the feed and `xmllint` to\nformat it. (You may need to install these tools.)\n\n```\ncurl -s http://localhost:8000/feed_rss_created.xml | xmllint --format -\n```\n\nYou may also want to try your feed with a feed reader. There are various desktop\nand mobile apps as well as online services. Of course, to use the latter you\nwill need to deploy your project somewhere that is accessible to them.\n</code></pre> <p>This minimal configuration should work well if you have not made any changes to the default configuration of the blog plugin.

Remember to add a colon at the end of the existing `tags` entry.\n\n    ```yaml hl_lines=\"8-9 17\"\n    plugins:\n        - search\n        - blog:\n            archive_date_format: MMMM yyyy\n            categories_allowed:\n                - Holidays\n                - News\n        - tags:\n            tags_file: blog/tags.md\n\n    nav:\n        - Home: index.md\n        - Install: install.md\n        - Usage: usage.md\n        - Blog:\n            - blog/index.md\n            - Tags: blog/tags.md\n    ```\n\n    The tag index will be appended to the configured page, which you should\n    now create at the location specified.\n\n    Note that you can put the tag index page anywhere in your primary\n    navigation, so if you are using tags elsewhere instead of just in your\n    blog then you may want to have the tag index outside the blog section\n    of the navigation.\n\n\n=== \"Insider Edition\"\n\n    To add a tag index, you add a placeholder in a Markdown file to tell\n    the plugin to insert an index at that point. This means that you\n    can add content before and after the index. Crucially, you can add\n    placeholders in multiple pages, each with a configuration of what\n    subset of tags should be displayed in the index.\n\n    The simplest index page looks like this. Create it under `docs/tags.md`.\n\n    ```markdown\n    # Tag index\n    &lt;!-- material/tags --&gt;\n    ```\n\n    Now, you may want to keep the tags for your blog separate from tags\n    you use in the rest of your page. You can achieve this by assigning\n    the tag index a scope. Put the following under `docs/blog/tags.md`:\n\n    ```markdown\n    # Tag index  for the blog\n    &lt;!-- material/tags { scope: true } --&gt;\n    ```\n\n    You now have two index pages: one covers the whole site and one\n    covers only the blog. Add both to the navigation:\n\n    ```yaml\n    nav:\n        - Home: index.md\n        - Tags: tags.md\n        - Blog:\n            - blog/index.md\n            - blog/tags.md\n    ```\n\n    The tags plugin in the Insider Edition is an incredibly powerful tool\n    and we can only scratch the surface of what is possible with it.

You also need to write a function that returns that\nfunction.\n\nSay you want to define two slugify functions that you can switch between.\nThe first one returns a slug similar to what the default slugify function\nproduces. The second one cuts the result of that up into words and returns\na slug based on a maximum of five of them:\n\n```python\nimport re, functools, unicodedata\n\nRE_HTML_TAGS = re.compile(r'&lt;/?[^&gt;]*&gt;', re.UNICODE)\nRE_INVALID_SLUG_CHAR = re.compile(r'[^\\w\\- ]', re.UNICODE)\nRE_WHITESPACE = re.compile(r'\\s', re.UNICODE)\n\ndef _make_slug(text, sep, **kwargs):\n    slug = unicodedata.normalize('NFC', text)\n    slug = RE_HTML_TAGS.sub('', slug)\n    slug = RE_INVALID_SLUG_CHAR.sub('', slug)\n    slug = slug.strip().lower()\n    slug = RE_WHITESPACE.sub(sep, slug)\n    return slug\n\ndef _make_slug_short(text, sep, **kwargs):\n    words = _make_slug(text, sep, **kwargs).split(sep)\n    return sep.join(words[:5])\n\ndef slugify(**kwargs):\n    if 'short' in kwargs and kwargs['short']:\n        return functools.partial(_make_slug_short, **kwargs)\n    return functools.partial(_make_slug, **kwargs)\n```\nSave this code in `ext/slugs.py` and also add an (empty) `__init__.py`\nfile to indicate that the directory is a module. Now you can configure\nyour custom slugify code like this:\n\n```yaml hl_lines=\"4-6\"\nplugins:\n- blog:\n    # other entries omitted\n    post_slugify: !!python/object/apply:ext.slugs.slugify\n      kwds:\n        short: true\n```\n\nChange the heading of a blog post to be longer than five words and observe\nhow the slugify function shortens the URL. Change the `short` attribute to\n`false` and you can turn this off again.\n</code></pre> <p>If you want to influence the slug only for a single blog post, you can define it manually by specifying it in the header of the post. Note that this is meant as a last resort option. Specifying a custom slug manually for every post would be tedious.</p> <p>!!! example \"Manually define slug\"</p> <pre><code>If, for example, you wanted the slug to be 'ny-eve'  instead of the somewhat\nlengthy 'happy-new-years-eve', you could add the following:\n\n```hl_lines=\"7\"\n---\ndate:\n  created: 2023-12-31\n  updated: 2024-01-02\nreadtime: 15\npin: true\nslug: ny-eve\n---\n```\n\nThe URL for this post should now be\n`http://localhost:8000/blog/2023/01/31/ny-eve/`.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tutorials/blogs/navigation/#whats-next","title":"What's next?","text":"<p>You may want to increase engagement with your blog by allowing people to subscribe to an RSS feed, by providing links to your social media profiles, by providing share and like buttons, or by setting up a comment system.
